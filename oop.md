Opp- object Oriented Programming

Try to mimic the real world into classes (object). The behaviour of a class is represented
by attributes and actions are executed by methods.




-Classes (objects)
    -Polymorphism
    -Inheritance
-members
    -Attributes
    -Methods
    -Messages
    -Local variables
    -Access Operators
    -Accessibility
    -Encapsulation
    -Interface
    
Syntax of c class:
class NAME:
    #attributes
    #methods
 
    Examplel
        class person:  
            name= "John"
             age= 37   
   
Write a few classes that serves a system for a school using basic OOP princeiples: 

-First you understand the basic of the requirements
    -you understand a bit of the domain that needs to be represented in classes
Person    
    Students
    Instructors: wagw
    Coordinator: wage
Programs
    Levels
        Lessons
Material
Administration

class Person:
    name = "john"
    age = 37
    program = "DevOps course"
    type = "Student"
class Person:
    name = "jane"
    age = 34
    program = "DevOps course"
    type = "Coodinator"
    
class Person:
    name = "Bruce"
    age = 35
    program = "DevOps course"
    type = "instructor"
    
class Person:
    name = "Mary"
    age = 22
    program = "DevOps course"
    type = "Student"
    

1           2          3
Input ->process -> output
What is the input?
What are the processes required?
What is the expected output 


class Human:
    eyes = 2
    ears = 2
    arms = 2
       
class person:  
    name= "John"
    age= 37
